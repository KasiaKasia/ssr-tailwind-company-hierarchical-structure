# Example application for viewing employee structure 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

# About

The application has been designed with `WCAG` (`Web Content Accessibility Guidelines`) accessibility standards in mind, to ensure digital accessibility.
The project includes libraries such as: `@ngrx/store`, `TailwindCSS`. The `Composite design pattern` is also applied. You can run the project using SSR `Server-Side Rendering`.
Change detection using the `Zone.js` library has been switched to the `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()` method, in order to improve performance.

## Steps to run the application using SSR

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KasiaKasia/ssr-tailwind-company-hierarchical-structure.git

2. In the project directory, run the following commands:

- [ ] `npm i`
- [ ] `npm run watch`
- [ ] `npm run serve:ssr:ssr-tailwind-company-hierarchical-structure`

3. Next, open a web browser and navigate to the following address: http://localhost:4000/


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
